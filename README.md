## I'm Zyanya Valentina Velazquez Aldrete


I'm a second year  [Genomic Sciences](https://www.lcg.unam.mx/)  undergrad at  [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)'s  [Center for Genomic Sciences](https://www.ccg.unam.mx/en/)  (_CCG_), Interested in mathematical models, bioinformatics, molecular microbiology, computational biology and theory behind biological cycles.

I am currently collaborating on research projects focused on:

**Systems biology** --> Creating a minimal mathematical model to identify the regulatory system in pulmonary fibrosis.

**Molecular Microbiology** --> Where I am focused on the search for novel antimicrobial molecules isolated from Cozumel mangrove soil.

**Evolutionary genomics** --> Study of longevity in reptile communities based on their chromosomes.

My academic and research focus is on understanding the genomic and molecular mechanisms that regulate responses in regulatory systems.

I am particularly interested in complex diseases and the power of understanding them through:

+ Mathematical Modeling
+ Inheritance and Evolution in Populations
+ Systems Biology
+ Computational Biology
+ Microbiology
