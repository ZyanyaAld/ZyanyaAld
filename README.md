## I'm Zyanya Valentina Velazquez Aldrete


I'm a second year  [Genomic Sciences](https://www.lcg.unam.mx/)  undergrad at  [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)'s  [Center for Genomic Sciences](https://www.ccg.unam.mx/en/)  (_CCG_), Interested in mathematical models, bioinformatics, molecular microbiology, computational biology and theory behind biological cycles.

I am currently collaborating on research projects focused on:

**Systems biology** --> Creating a minimal mathematical model to identify the regulatory system in pulmonary fibrosis.
**Molecular microbiology** -->Where I am focused on the search for novel antimicrobial molecules isolated from Cozumel mangrove soil.

My academic and research focus is on understanding the genomic and molecular mechanisms that regulate responses in regulatory systems.

I am particularly interested in complex diseases and the power of understanding them through:

+ Mathematical Modeling
+ Inheritance and Evolution in Populations
+ Systems Biology
+ Computational Biology
+ Microbiology
